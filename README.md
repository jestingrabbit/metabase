# metaâ—†base

Hopefully, at some time in the future, a gui for designing databases.

I really wanted to get a backbone app right, and I think I did in this case. All of my views are returning themselves on render, so its easy to put views inside of views inside of views and easy to work out what object to associated with which views, and where to put listeners etc.

The part I haven't worked out fully yet is drawing the edges between associated tables, and that will take some real time to get right.
